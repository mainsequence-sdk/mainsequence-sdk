# Main Sequence Python SDK



The Main Sequence Python SDK is a high-performance client library that enables seamless integration with the Main Sequence platform. 
It provides a unified and intuitive interface for interacting with data, compute, and intelligence services across the platform.

Main Sequence functions as a centralized engine for data intelligence—integrating information from diverse data sources and systems
while abstracting away the complexity of underlying storage layers. This allows quants, researchers, analysts,
and engineers to focus on the data-generating process itself, while Main Sequence optimizes all CRUD operations and manages 
the mapping between logical data structures and physical storage.

The Main Sequence SDK is also a foundational component of all Main Sequence Platform projects. 
It acts as the backbone for automation, process orchestration, and the rapid development of dashboards,
data nodes, and agentic tools built on top of the platform.
