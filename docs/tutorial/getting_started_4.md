# Getting Started 4: Hydrating the Platform Markets-I

After you sign up, the Main Sequence platform starts **empty**. Its power comes from building **data workflows at scale**, so one of the first tasks is to **integrate your data sources**.

In this part of the tutorial, you’ll implement a few data nodes to start building data and financial applications.

## Assets in Main Sequence

Before moving forward, let’s recap the concept of an **asset**. Main Sequence is built not only to unify data sources, but also to unify how data relates to **financial instruments**.

The platform is already hydrated with information about many publicly traded assets. You can review the full list of asset attributes here:

https://github.com/mainsequence-sdk/mainsequence-sdk/blob/f3b42bd4f4478574b7375508b1b7441ca5c8d297/mainsequence/client/models_vam.py#L197

For this tutorial, focus on the most important fields when integrating with data nodes:

```python
class AssetMixin(BaseObjectOrm, BasePydanticModel):
    id: Optional[int] = None

    # Immutable identifiers
    unique_identifier: constr(max_length=255)
    is_custom_by_organization: bool = Field(
        default=False,
        description="Flag indicating if this asset was custom-created by the organization"
    )
```
As you saw earlier, `unique_identifier` lets you identify an asset as a **secondary index** in your tables.
For most assets this will be the FIGI. However, some assets won’t exist on https://www.openfigi.com.
In those cases, use the `is_custom_by_organization` flag to register a custom asset in the platform.

You’re not limited to classic “assets.” You can also create assets that represent **indices**,
**interest-rate curves**, or any other **unique identifier** for time‑series data.

## Example: Hydrating with U.S. Treasury Constant-Maturity Yields

To demonstrate, we’ll build a data node that hydrates the platform with
**interest‑rate curves** you can use later in fixed‑income applications (pricing, 
stress analysis, and more).

First, create a data node to store **constant‑maturity U.S. Treasury yields**.
We’ll source the data from **polygon.io**.

A complete `DataNode` implementation lives in the public data connectors repo:  
https://github.com/mainsequence-sdk/data-connectors  
Look under `data_connectors/prices/polygon/data_nodes.py`.

```python
class PolygonUSTCMTYields(PolygonEconomyNode):
    """
    Daily U.S. Treasury constant-maturity yields by tenor from Polygon Economy API.
    Identifiers: UST_<tenor}_CMT (e.g., UST_2Y_CMT)
    Columns:
      - days_to_maturity (int)
      - par_yield (decimal)
    """
```
### Creating or Resolving Assets in Code

In earlier examples, `get_asset_list` simply returned assets that already existed. 
Here, you’ll **create the assets on the fly** if they’re missing.
We also attach optional properties such as `security_market_sector`, 
`security_type`, and `security_type_2` to enable richer filtering on the platform.
You can find `build_assets` method in the same file as above:

```python
def build_assets(self) -> List[msc.Asset]:
    payload = []
    for tenor in UST_CMT_FIELD_BY_TENOR:
        identifier = f"UST_{tenor}_CMT"
        snapshot = {"name": identifier, "ticker": identifier, "exchange_code": "US_TREASURY"}
        payload.append({
            "unique_identifier": identifier,
            "snapshot": snapshot,
            "security_market_sector": msc.MARKETS_CONSTANTS.FIGI_MARKET_SECTOR_GOVT,
            "security_type": msc.MARKETS_CONSTANTS.FIGI_SECURITY_TYPE_DOMESTIC,
            "security_type_2": msc.MARKETS_CONSTANTS.FIGI_SECURITY_TYPE_2_GOVT,
        })
    asset_list = msc.Asset.batch_get_or_register_custom_assets(payload)
    return asset_list

def get_asset_list(self) -> List[msc.Asset]:
    return self.build_assets()
```
As in the previous tutorial, you can copy code files and snippets from **data connectors** repository into your tutorial project and adjust the imports making sure they point to the correct locations to ensure that `PolygonUSTCMTYields` works correctly and create a **run endpoint** to update the data for the first time.

But if you not sure how to do it, you can go with simple approach described below.
1. Open you PowerShell or terminal and navigate to some temporary folder outside of your tutorial project.
2. Clone the data-connectors repository there:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mainsequence-sdk/data-connectors.git
```
3. Use your file explorer to open the cloned `data-connectors` folder.
4. Copy the whole `data_connectors/` you can find inside the cloned folder to the `src/` folder of your tutorial project.
5. Now you can delete the cloned before `data-connectors` folder as you already copied necessary code to your tutorial project.
6. Now you are ready to run the `PolygonUSTCMTYields` data node in your tutorial project.

So after you copied code from `data-connectors` repository for the `PolygonUSTCMTYields` class you need to create a new runner file in `scripts` folder with a name `run_ust_cmt_yields.py` and add this code to it:

```python
from src.data_connectors.prices.polygon.data_nodes import PolygonUSTCMTYields
from mainsequence.client import Constant as _C

data_node = PolygonUSTCMTYields()
data_node.run(debug_mode=True, force_update=True)
```

Now you need is to get your API key from polygon.io and add it as environment variable `POLYGON_API_KEY` in the `.env` file in the root of your project.

Register and request your API key here [https://polygon.io/](https://polygon.io/)

```env
POLYGON_API_KEY="your_polygon_api_key_here"
```


After that you can add a new entry to your `.vscode\launch.json` file in `configurations` list:

(Windows):
```json
{
    "name": "Debug ust_cmt_yields",
    "type": "debugpy",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}\\scripts\\run_ust_cmt_yields.py",
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceFolder}"
    },
    "python": "${workspaceFolder}\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe"
}
```
(macOS/Linux):
```json
{
    "name": "Debug ust_cmt_yields",
    "type": "debugpy",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/scripts/run_ust_cmt_yields.py",
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceFolder}"
    },
    "python": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python"
}
```

Then back to `run_ust_cmt_yields.py` file and run it from the Run and Debug dropdown at the top right (near the play button), same way as you done it in previous parts of the tutorial.

After running the node, you should see the table in the platform: [https://main-sequence.app/dynamic-table-metadatas/?search=polygonustcmtyields_&storage_hash=&identifier=](https://main-sequence.app/dynamic-table-metadatas/?search=polygonustcmtyields_&storage_hash=&identifier=)

> Note: it also possible to simply fork whole `data-connectors` project on MainSequence platform and handle it as a separate project completely independent from your tutorial project, but we recommend to stick to instructions above to keep your tutorial project clean and simple and available to reference later. So next instructions are just for your information if you want to try it out.
To fork the repo into new project:
1. Go to [https://main-sequence.app/projects/](https://main-sequence.app/projects/)
2. Find project with "data_connectors" name and click on it
3. In the top right corner you see three dots menu, open it and  click on "Fork Project" button, assing it name like "my_data_connectors" and click on "Fork".
4. Than you can set up new project locally as you done before in previous parts of tutorial and work with this new project afterwards e. g. add `run_ust_cmt_yields.py` file and new entry in `.vscode/launch.json` to run it.
5. Don't forget to add your polygon API key as environment variable `POLYGON_API_KEY` in the `.env` file in the root of your new project, then follow this tutorial.


## From CMT Yields to a Zero Curve

Next, build a **zero curve** and store it in a `zero_curves` data node. 
The idea is to provide a backend data node from which you can retrieve different curves
and use them to value fixed‑income instruments (e.g., custom swaps or floating‑rate coupon bonds).

We provide a **curve registry factory** that can serve as a blueprint for your projects.
You can keep ours or implement your own; to move quickly, we recommend using ours initially.

The zero‑curve `DataNode` can be found at `data_connectors/interest_rates/nodes.py`:

```python
class DiscountCurves(DataNode):
    ...

    def update(self):
        # Download CSV from source
        df = DISCOUNT_CURVE_BUILD_REGISTRY[self.curve_config.unique_identifier](
            update_statistics=self.update_statistics,
            curve_unique_identifier=self.curve_config.unique_identifier,
            base_node_curve_points=self.base_node_curve_points,
        )

        # Apply the new compression and encoding function to the 'curve' column.
        df["curve"] = df["curve"].apply(compress_curve_to_string)

        last_update = self.update_statistics.get_last_update_index_2d(self.curve_config.unique_identifier)
        df = df[df.index.get_level_values("time_index") > last_update]

        if df.empty:
            return pd.DataFrame()

        return df
```
The method above is **generic**. What you need is a registry entry that points a **curve identifier** to a **build function**.

Because we previously copied the `data_connectors` folder into your tutorial project, you already have the curve registry implemented, but it still need to be adjusted.

Make sure that `data_connectors/interest_rates/registries/discount_curves.py` exists and looks exactly like this, and adjust code if necessary:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import Callable, Dict, Mapping

# Provider builders / constants
from mainsequence.client import Constant as _C

# UST CMT (Polygon) — keep source-specific UID in its own settings module
from data_connectors.prices.polygon.builders import bootstrap_cmt_curve

def _merge_unique(*maps: Mapping[str, Callable]) -> Dict[str, Callable]:
    out: Dict[str, Callable] = {}
    for m in maps:
        for k, v in m.items():
            if k in out and out[k] is not v:
                raise ValueError(f"Duplicate registry key with different builder: {k}")
            out[k] = v
    return out

# Base maps per source (explicit so adding/removing sources is easy)

"""
signtaure for each zero curfe function should be like the one bellow
def bootstrap_cmt_curve(update_statistics, curve_unique_identifier: str, base_node_curve_points:APIDataNode):
and should 
 Returns one dataframe with:
         - MultiIndex ("time_index", "unique_identifier")
         - Column "curve": dict[days_to_maturity] → zero_rate (percent)

where unique_identifier is the name of this zero_curve, we recommend that you 
build a constant in the backend to retrieve this specific curve
"""
_POLYGON_CURVES = {
    _C.get_value(name="ZERO_CURVE__UST_CMT_ZERO_CURVE_UID"): bootstrap_cmt_curve,
}

# ---- Public, aggregated registry ----
DISCOUNT_CURVE_BUILD_REGISTRY: Dict[str, Callable] = _merge_unique(
    _POLYGON_CURVES
)
```
### Constants: 

Notice the import of `mainsequence.client.Constant`. As you build multiple applications across 
data nodes and projects, it’s useful to fetch **constants** via the API. 
Main Sequence supports both **global constants** (available across the platform) 
and **project‑scoped constants** (limited to a project).

To keep things orderly without adding complexity,
constants can be grouped by **category** using a double underscore `__` as a separator. 
The name of the constant doesn’t change, but the platform groups related constants for easier
filtering and visualization.

**Where are these constants created?** To ensure a curve constant exists, we run a **get‑or‑create** operation when importing the `prices/polygon/__init__.py` module:

```python
constants_to_create = dict(
    POLYGON__UST_CMT_YIELDS_TABLE_UID=UST_CMT_YIELDS_TABLE_UID,
    ZERO_CURVE__UST_CMT_ZERO_CURVE_UID="polygon_ust_cmt_zero_curve_usd",
)

_C.create_constants_if_not_exist(constants_to_create)
```

## Interest rate fixing DataNode

So far, we’ve used the `zero_curve` registry helper from `data_connectors` to model future cash flows. However, with most pricing libraries — including QuantLib — we also need past fixing dates to price cash flows whose fixings occurred in the past.

Below, let’s look at `data_connectors/prices/fred/data_nodes.py`. Here we have a data node designed to integrate economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) - `FixingRatesNode`.

Create a new runner file in `scripts` folder with a name `run_fred_fixings.py` and add this code to it:

```python
from src.data_connectors.prices.fred.data_nodes import FixingRatesNode, FixingRateConfig, RateConfig
from mainsequence.client import Constant as _C

USD_SOFR = _C.get_value(name="REFERENCE_RATE__USD_SOFR")
USD_EFFR = _C.get_value(name="REFERENCE_RATE__USD_EFFR")
USD_OBFR = _C.get_value(name="REFERENCE_RATE__USD_OBFR")
fixing_config = FixingRateConfig(rates_config_list=[
RateConfig(unique_identifier=USD_SOFR,
            name=f"Secured Overnight Financing Rate "),
RateConfig(unique_identifier=USD_EFFR,
            name=f"Effective Federal Funds Rate "),
RateConfig(unique_identifier=USD_OBFR,
            name=f"Overnight Bank Funding Rate"),
    ])
ts = FixingRatesNode(rates_config=fixing_config)
ts.run(debug_mode=True, force_update=True)
```


Now you can add a new entry to your `.vscode\launch.json` file in `configurations` list:

(Windows):
```json
{
    "name": "Debug fred_fixings",
    "type": "debugpy",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}\\scripts\\run_fred_fixings.py",
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceFolder}"
    },
    "python": "${workspaceFolder}\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe"
}
```
(macOS/Linux):
```json
{
    "name": "Debug fred_fixings",
    "type": "debugpy",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/scripts/run_fred_fixings.py",
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceFolder}"
    },
    "python": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python"
}
```

Before you be able to run this you need to get an API key from FRED and add it as environment variable `FRED_API_KEY` in the `.env` file in the root of your project.
```env
FRED_API_KEY="your_fred_api_key_here"
```

Register and request your API key here:

[https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/apikeys](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/apikeys)


Then back to `run_fred_fixings.py` file and run it from the Run and Debug dropdown at the top right (near the play button) and use `Debug fred_fixings` configuration.


## One‑Shot Runner

Here’s how everything looks if you want to run it all at once in single script:

```python
from data_connectors.prices.polygon.data_nodes import PolygonUSTCMTYields

data_node = PolygonUSTCMTYields()
data_node.run(debug_mode=True, force_update=True)

from data_connectors.prices.polygon.settings import UST_CMT_YIELDS_TABLE_UID
from data_connectors.interest_rates.nodes import (DiscountCurves, CurveConfig,)
config = CurveConfig(
    unique_identifier=_C.get_value("ZERO_CURVE__UST_CMT_ZERO_CURVE_UID"),
    name="Discount Curve UST Bootstrapped",
    curve_points_dependecy_data_node_uid=UST_CMT_YIELDS_TABLE_UID,
)
node = DiscountCurves(curve_config=config)
node.run(debug_mode=True, force_update=True)
```

## Instruments Configuration

Before moving on to the next part of the tutorial, let’s look back at the two *DataNodes* referenced in the `data_connectors.interest_rates.get_table_metadata` methods. As with any other DataNode, we assign identifiers to these two tables. This matters because we’ll use them in our instrument settings when pricing fixed-income instruments.

To prepare for the next section:

1. Open [https://main-sequence.app/instruments/config/](https://main-sequence.app/instruments/config/).
2. Make sure the configurations for **Discount Curves Storage Node** and **Reference Rates Fixings Storage Node** are set.


![img.png](img.png)

```python

class DiscountCurves(DataNode):
    
    def get_table_metadata(self) -> msc.TableMetaData:
        return msc.TableMetaData(
            identifier=DISCOUNT_CURVES_TABLE_NAME,
            data_frequency_id=msc.DataFrequency.one_d,
            description="Collection of Discount Curves"
        )

class FixingRatesNode(DataNode):
    def get_table_metadata(self) -> msc.TableMetaData:
        return msc.TableMetaData(
            identifier=FIXING_RATES_1D_TABLE_NAME,
            data_frequency_id=msc.DataFrequency.one_d,
            description=f"Daily fixing rates ",
        )
```
