# Introduction to the Main Sequence Python SDK

The **Main Sequence Python SDK** is a powerful set of client libraries designed to facilitate interaction with Main Sequence systems using Python. The SDK covers four main components:

1. **TDAG:** A Time Series Data Orchestration and Scheduling Tool.
2. **Client:** The Main Sequence client for interacting with the Main Sequence API.
3. **VirtualFundBuilder:** A collection of classes and methods to quickly build portfolios and interact with our AI agents.
4. **Examples:** A comprehensive collection of examples demonstrating how to build portfolios and interact with our AI agents.

## How the Documentation is Organized

The documentation follows the same structure as the SDK. Within each topic, we delve deeper into the logic and usage.

Additionally, we provide an extensive set of examples within the repository here:  
[Example Repository](https://github.com/mainsequence-sdk/mainsequence-sdk/tree/main/mainsequence).

The examples section is organized by use-case rather than by individual libraries.

You can find a full video tutorial here:

Recordings of our previous bootcamps are also available here:
